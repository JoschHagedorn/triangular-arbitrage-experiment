# Exploring Triangular Arbitrage Opportunities on Binance

Triangular arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits price discrepancies between three different (crypto-) currencies to generate profit. This project focuses on exploring triangular arbitrage opportunities on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

**Objective:** \
The goal of this project is to analyze real-time data from the Binance exchange to identify and understand patterns in triangular arbitrage opportunities. This public version of the project has the trade execution logic removed and instead focuses on the collection and analysis of data. It serves as a proof of concept for potential trading strategies.

**Disclaimer:** \
This project is for educational and research purposes only. Any trading decisions should be based on your own analysis and risk tolerance.

## Triangular Arbitrage

Triangular arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits price discrepancies between three different assets in the foreign exchange or cryptocurrency markets to generate profit. The basic concept behind triangular arbitrage is the principle of a "no-risk" opportunity due to pricing inefficiencies. Traders monitor exchange rates of three currency pairs that are related, such as USD/EUR, EUR/GBP, and GBP/USD in the forex market, or BTC/ETH, ETH/LTC, and LTC/BTC in the cryptocurrency market. If the exchange rates do not align according to the theoretical exchange rate calculated from the three pairs, an arbitrage opportunity is detected. The trader executes a series of trades to exploit the price discrepancy, starting with one currency, converting it to another, and then back to the original currency, ending up with more of the original currency than they started with. By the end of the series of trades, the trader will have made a profit due to the pricing inefficiency, assuming the trades are executed quickly enough to capitalize on the opportunity before market conditions change.

Triangular arbitrage helps to maintain efficient pricing in the market by quickly correcting pricing discrepancies.
